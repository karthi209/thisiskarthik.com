<h1>Meta</h1>

<p>This site is just HTML and CSS compiled into static pages using a blog generator I wrote in Go because I got tired of platforms that change their terms of service every Tuesday. A full build of this site takes 2 milliseconds which is longer than zero but shorter than most modern websites take to load, and almost everything lives in the static build which means few moving parts and fewer things to break.</p>

<p><strong>Typography</strong></p>

<p>Bricolage Grotesk for everything because it's a modern geometric sans-serif that's clean and readable and has that indie aesthetic without being too weird, with system fonts as fallback for older browsers. Body text uses regular weight (400) for comfortable reading, while headings use semibold (600) for better distinction.</p>

<p><strong>How It Works</strong></p>

<p>Custom static site generator in Go with Goldmark for Markdown and YAML for frontmatter and no build tools and no dependencies that will break next week, and the code is simple and readable with no clever abstractions that will confuse future me.</p>

<p><strong>Colors</strong></p>

<p>Background is #1e1e1e which is a muted dark gray that's easy on the eyes for long reading sessions, and text is #e8e8e8 which is off-white for good contrast without being harsh, and the accent is #00d9ff which is a bright cyan for links and highlights that stands out without being too saturated.</p>

<p><strong>Source Code</strong></p>

<p>It's all on <a href="https://github.com/karthi209/thisiskarthik.com.git" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a> if you're into that sort of thing.</p>

<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>

<p>Fonts are loaded with preconnect hints and display=swap to minimize layout shifts, and the site uses semantic HTML and minimal CSS for fast loading and good performance across all devices.</p>
