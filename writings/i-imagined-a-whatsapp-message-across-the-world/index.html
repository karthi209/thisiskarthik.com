  <p>I had too much free time the other day (always dangerous), so instead of doing something useful, I got curious about what actually happens when I send a WhatsApp message from Bangalore to someone in San Francisco. Just a simple &quot;Hi&quot;. So I tried to trace the journey. I made some assumptions along the way, but hey, the whole internet is basically built on assumptions anyway.</p>
<p>I'm in Bangalore (okay fine, I'm actually in Chennai, but let's pretend I'm in Bangalore for this story). I type <strong>&quot;Hi&quot;</strong> on my phone and hit send.</p>
<p>First thing WhatsApp does is it scrambles my message using something called the Signal Protocol. Basically, before my &quot;Hi&quot; even leaves my phone, it's already gibberish to everyone except the person I'm sending it to. Even if I somehow intercepted it myself, I couldn't read it. Then this encrypted gibberish gets chopped up into tiny little TCP/IP packets because the internet doesn't trust anything that's too big or complete.</p>
<p>These little packets then zip out of my phone using Airtel 5G (which is what I use). They bounce to the nearest cell tower and then goes through Airtel's network around the city eventually landing at something called a Metro Point of Presence, probably somewhere around Whitefield or Bellandur. At this point, my &quot;Hi&quot; has already seen more of Bangalore than I have. From Bangalore, the packets head to Chennai over some long fiber cables, roughly following NH48.</p>
<p>PS: This might be the most peaceful Bangalore Chennai journey ever made.</p>
<p>The packets roll into Chennai and hit something called the NIXI Internet Exchange Point. This is basically where all the networks meet up, shake hands, and figure out who's going to carry what next. Like a really polite, really fast handoff.</p>
<p>From there, Airtel sends the packets to its Cable Landing Station in Chennai. This is where things get interesting.</p>
<p>At the Cable Landing Station, my electrical signals get converted into light signals. The packets are now ready for their submarine adventure.</p>
<p>They jump into Airtel's i2i underwater cable (which can handle 8.4 Tbps, whatever that means in human terms), and start swimming from Chennai to Singapore. My &quot;Hi&quot; is now underwater, surrounded by fish. I'm still sitting at home, probably eating chips.</p>
<p>The packets surface at Airtel's Cable Landing Station in Tuas, Singapore.</p>
<p>Here's where it gets fancy. Airtel politely hands off my packets to Tata Communications. It's a very professional, very expensive handshake. Like a business deal, but for data.</p>
<p>Tata then routes the packets into its TGN‑Intra Asia submarine cable system, heading toward Japan and Guam. My &quot;Hi&quot; is now on an international adventure.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the middle of the Pacific Ocean (which is huge, by the way), the packets switch from TGN‑Intra Asia to Tata's TGN‑Pacific cable system.</p>
<p>At this point, my message is probably surrounded by fish who couldn't care less about WhatsApp. They're just swimming around, minding their own business, while my &quot;Hi&quot; zips past them at the speed of light.</p>
<p>The light signals finally reach Tata's Cable Landing Station in Los Angeles County, California. They get converted back into electrical signals and dumped into the land-based networks. My packets are officially back on dry land.</p>
<p>From there, the packets get routed to a major Internet Exchange Point on the West Coast, probably something like Equinix LA1.</p>
<p>At the exchange, the packets get handed to Meta's infrastructure. This could be a data center or a CDN nearby, where WhatsApp does all its server-side stuff. Metadata checks, delivery logic, all that boring but necessary backend work.</p>
<p>Important note: Nobody actually reads the message. It's still encrypted. Even Meta just sees a mysterious encrypted box that says &quot;trust me, bro&quot;. Privacy is still intact.</p>
<p>After Meta does its thing, the packets get handed off again, this time to Comcast.</p>
<p>Comcast's network carries the packets about 350 miles north to San Francisco. This journey is still faster than getting food delivered during peak hours. Just saying.</p>
<p>From Comcast's local network, the packets travel that last mile using DOCSIS or fiber, reach the recipient's phone, and get put back together in the right order.</p>
<p>WhatsApp decrypts the message.</p>
<p>And finally, the recipient sees:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Hi&quot;</strong></p>
<h3 id="so-what-just-happened">So what just happened?</h3>
<p>A two‑letter word.<br />
Multiple cities.<br />
Two countries.<br />
One massive ocean.<br />
Several underwater cables.</p>
<p>All of this happens in under a second. And you know what reply I usually get?</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Seen&quot;</strong></p>
<p>That's it. That's the whole journey.</p>
