<h1>Meta</h1>

<p>This site is just HTML and CSS compiled into static pages using a blog generator I wrote in Go because I got tired of platforms that change their terms of service every Tuesday. I post a lot on Twitter, and I realized late that you don't actually own anything you post there, so everything I write online, this website will have a copy of it all, and it's just HTML and CSS compiled into static pages using a custom Go static site generator... just my words on my domain under my control. A full build of this site takes {{.BuildTime}} milliseconds which is longer than zero but shorter than most modern websites take to load, and almost everything lives in the static build which means few moving parts and fewer things to break.</p>

<p><strong>Typography</strong></p>

<p>Bricolage Grotesk for everything because why not.</p>

<p><strong>Colors</strong></p>

<p>Background is #1e1e1e which is a muted dark gray that's easy on the eyes for long reading sessions, and text is #e8e8e8 which is off-white for good contrast without being harsh, and the accent is #00d9ff which is a bright cyan for links and highlights that stands out without being too saturated. Still experimenting with the colors!</p>

<p><strong>Source Code</strong></p>

<p>It's all on <a href="https://github.com/karthi209/thisiskarthik.com.git" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a> if you're into that sort of thing.</p>
