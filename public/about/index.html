<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hello there! I see you've found the About page. So, I suppose I should tell you a little about me and this site.</p>

<p>I'm Karthik. I live in Chennai, India, and I work as a systems engineer by day. At night, I'm a vampire. I....oh. No. Sorry. Forget I ever said that.</p>

<p>Apart from my day job, I love writing, cartography, programming, talking about public transit, and many other things. I'd probably need a whole day to explain them all.</p>

<p>That's one of the reasons I created this site. It gives me a place to organise my thoughts while also being able to share them. It's also why the site looks very much like a small book, both aesthetically and practically.</p>

<p>For more details about the site's design, inspiration, and technical details, see the <a href="/meta">Meta</a>.</p>

<p>You can reach me via <a href="mailto:hello@thisiskarthik.com">email</a>, <a href="https://x.com/karthi9003" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/karthi209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p>
