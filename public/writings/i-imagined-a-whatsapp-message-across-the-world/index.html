              <p>The other day, I found myself stuck at the RTO, waiting for my turn to renew the RC for one of my vehicles. It was the kind of mind torturing wait where even looking at a ceiling fan spin starts to look kinda entertaining. To save myself from losing my mind, I picked up my phone and pinged a friend, hoping for a distraction. But as soon as the message delivered, my mind fueled by sheer boredom started asking weird questions about how those two letters could possibly travel across the world that quickly. So, right there in the middle of that government office, I decided to try and trace the actual journey of those bits.. it’s not like the bureaucracy was in any hurry to call my number anyway.</p>
<p>The Rules!</p>
<p>Before I could start tracing the messages I first need to set some ground rules for myself. You see the internet is a big place. There are too many possibilities and too many paths just like a real road trip between two cities, so you need to first plan your trip before you set off. For the sake of this story, let’s pretend I’m in Bangalore, although I’m actually in Chennai. Now,  I type that &quot;Hi&quot; on my phone and hit send. The very first thing WhatsApp does is scramble my message using something called the Signal Protocol, which basically means that before the &quot;Hi&quot; even leaves my phone, it’s already been turned into absolute gibberish to everyone except the person I’m sending it to.</p>
<p>Hi &gt; sdfwd</p>
<p>Even if I somehow managed to intercept the signal myself, I wouldn't be able to read it, and then this encrypted nonsense gets chopped up into tiny little TCP/IP packets because the internet doesn't trust anything that's too big or comes in a single, complete piece.</p>
<p>These little packets zip out of my phone using my Airtel 5G connection, bouncing to the nearest cell tower before winding through Airtel's local network around the city and eventually landing at something called a Metro Point of Presence, likely somewhere around Whitefield or Bellandur. From there, the packets head toward Chennai over long fiber-optic cables that roughly follow the NH48 highway. I like to think of this as the most peaceful Bangalore-to-Chennai journey ever made, free from the usual potholes and bus drivers.</p>
<p>Phase 2: The Underwater Marathon (The Indian Ocean)</p>
<p>Once the packets roll into Chennai, they hit the NIXI Internet Exchange Point, which is basically a place where all the different networks meet up and shake hands in a very polite and incredibly fast digital handoff. From there, Airtel sends the packets to its Cable Landing Station in Chennai, and this is where things get interesting because my electrical signals get converted into pulses of light. Now that they are made of light, the packets are ready for their massive submarine adventure under the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>They jump into Airtel's i2i underwater cable and start swimming from Chennai all the way to Singapore. My &quot;Hi&quot; is now officially underwater and surrounded by deep-sea fish, while I’m still sitting at home on my couch, probably eating a bag of chips. The packets eventually surface at a landing station in Tuas, Singapore, where Airtel politely hands my data over to Tata Communications in a very professional and very expensive digital handshake.</p>
<p>Phase 3: Crossing the Pacific (Singapore to California)</p>
<p>Tata then routes the packets into its own submarine cable system, heading out toward Japan and Guam, meaning my &quot;Hi&quot; is now on a legitimate international vacation across the Pacific Ocean. Somewhere in the middle of the Pacific—which is an alarmingly large body of water, by the way—the packets switch cable systems again while being surrounded by fish who couldn't care less about my social life. These fish are just minding their own business while my greeting zips past their fins at the speed of light, eventually reaching a landing station in Los Angeles County, California.</p>
<p>Phase 4: The Final Mile (California to San Francisco)</p>
<p>In California, the light signals are converted back into electrical signals and dumped into land-based networks, meaning my packets are finally back on dry land after thousands of miles of swimming. They get routed to a major Internet Exchange Point, likely something like Equinix LA1, where they are finally handed over to Meta's own infrastructure so WhatsApp can do its server-side chores. It’s important to note that nobody at Meta is actually reading the message; it’s still an encrypted box that basically says &quot;trust me, bro,&quot; so the privacy of my two-letter word remains intact.</p>
<p>After Meta is done with its part, the packets are handed off yet again, this time to Comcast, whose network carries them about 350 miles north toward San Francisco. This part of the journey is still significantly faster than getting food delivered during peak hours, and once the packets reach the local network in San Francisco, they reach the recipient’s phone. The phone puts all the tiny pieces back together in the right order, WhatsApp decrypts the gibberish, and finally, the recipient sees those two letters on their screen.</p>
<p>Try It Yourself (The Reality Check)</p>
<p>If you don't believe that your data is actually out there seeing the world while you're staring at a loading icon, you can actually trace it yourself. It’s a very satisfying way to feel like a hacker without actually doing anything illegal.</p>
<p>If you’re on a Mac or Linux, open your Terminal. If you’re on Windows, open Command Prompt. Type traceroute google.com (or tracert google.com on Windows) and hit enter. You’ll see a list of &quot;hops&quot; appearing one by one. The first one is just your home router. The next few are your ISP’s local servers in your city. But eventually, you’ll see the names of cities or landing stations—maybe Singapore, maybe London, maybe New York—popping up in the text.</p>
<p>Each line represents a router that just touched your data and passed it along. If you see a bunch of * * * on a line, it just means that specific router is shy and doesn't want to talk to you. You can take any of those IP addresses, put them into a &quot;Geographic IP&quot; website, and see exactly where in the world your data was just a few milliseconds ago.</p>
<p>The Result</p>
<p>So, when you think about it, a two-letter word just traveled through multiple cities, two countries, and one massive ocean via several underwater cables, all in under a second. It’s a miracle of modern engineering, and do you know what reply I usually get after all that effort?</p>
<p>&quot;Seen.&quot;</p>
<p>That’s it. That is the whole journey.</p>
