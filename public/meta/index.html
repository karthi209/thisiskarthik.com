<h1>Meta</h1>

<p>This site is just HTML and CSS compiled into static pages. I wrote a blog generator in Go because I got tired of platforms that change their terms of service every Tuesday and frameworks whose dependencies break every Friday.</p>

<p>A full build takes 2 milliseconds. That's longer than zero, but shorter than most modern websites take to load.</p>

<p>Almost everything lives in the static build. Few moving parts means fewer things to break at 2am.</p>

<p><strong>Design Philosophy</strong></p>

<p>The site has a subtle Commodore 64 aesthetic. IBM Plex Mono everywhere. Cyan accents. ASCII box-drawing characters. Dark theme. Zero JavaScript.</p>

<p>It's designed to be readable, fast, and still work in 20 years when everything else has broken.</p>

<p><strong>Typography</strong></p>

<p>IBM Plex Mono for everything. It's monospace, but actually readable. Good for both UI elements and body text. Gives that retro computing feel without sacrificing legibility.</p>

<p><strong>How It Works</strong></p>

<p>Custom static site generator in Go. Goldmark for Markdown. YAML for frontmatter. No build tools. No dependencies that will break next week.</p>

<p>The code is simple and readable. No clever abstractions that will confuse future me.</p>

<p><strong>Colors</strong></p>

<p>Background: #1a1a2e (dark but not black)</p>

<p>Text: #eaeaea (off-white, easy on the eyes)</p>

<p>Accent: #00d9ff (cyan, very C64)</p>

<p><strong>Source Code</strong></p>

<p>It's all on <a href="https://github.com/karthi209/thisiskarthik.com.git" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a> if you're into that sort of thing.</p>
