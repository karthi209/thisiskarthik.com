As a kid, I loved watches. I didn’t own many. Actually, I didn’t own any at all until 8th grade, when my grandmother gifted me my first one. It was a Titan Zoop. One of those kids' analog quartz watches. Small dial. Light blue strap. Thin enough to disappear on my wrist. There was also a darker blue back strap for “support”, though I never quite understood what exactly it was supporting.

I hated wearing it. It looked delicate. Almost decorative. Meanwhile, my friends had watches with stopwatches, alarms, backlights, and enough buttons to qualify as military equipment. I still wore mine everyday because having a watch was better than having no watch. For a while, I wore it on my right hand. I was right-handed, so this seemed logical. I was later informed by multiple people that this was incorrect.

By 11th grade, I had a new plan: buy my own watch.

I saved ₹1000 over several months. Ten rupees at a time that I would siphon off from multiple sources that'll remain unnamed. My main excuse for those ten rupee was cycle repair. My cycle, incidentally, was in excellent health. One Friday evening, I rode straight to the nearest watch shop and delivered the most confident sentence I had ever spoken:

“I have ₹1000. Show me what you have.”

My requirements were simple. It should look good.

I bought a Sonata. Fully digital. Backlight. Alarm. Stopwatch. Buttons. Finally, a serious watch. I wore it every day for the next three years. Including in my sleep.

Eventually, like most wishes, it lost its magic. I stopped caring about watches. After all, I was wearing one every day. Around the fifth year, that Sonata stopped working. This was not a tragedy. It had been showing early signs of decline for a while. Also, I had a smartphone now. Why would anyone need a watch in the age of smartphones? I told myself this with confidence until the Mi Band appeared. It wasn’t even a watch. Just a fitness tracker. No screen. No time. But still I bought one immediately.

It sat on my wrist, silently collecting information and sending it to my phone. It didn’t tell time. It didn’t do much of anything. I loved it. I enjoyed the data. The graphs. The illusion of productivity. I kept wearing it long after I stopped caring about the tracking. Mostly because it had become part of my arm. Later, Xiaomi released the next Mi Band. This one had a screen. It showed time. It showed stats. It showed calls. It had a battery life of nearly 20 days. I was back in love.

It was simple. Functional. No drama. I only had to charge it once every couple of weeks. This was perfection. Until I lost it. I was on a trip to Goa, sitting in a shallow river with friends. A small stream. A tiny waterfall. I was enjoying myself when I felt something brush past my hand. I assumed it was a fish. Or some debris. 

It was my watch.

The strap had come loose. The river accepted its offering. The sadness. I decided I was done with watches. I would wear a bracelet. Or nothing. I was free.

Then Amazon flashed an offer on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4. It did everything. Apps. Calls. Maps. Voice assistant. Music. Notifications. A computer on my wrist. I was overwhelmed. This felt like the future. For about a month. Then the battery life started dictating my schedule. One day of charge meant constant anxiety. Forget to charge it once, and I’d spend the next day wearing a very expensive black mirror.

People would ask me for the time.

I would look at my wrist.

Then at them.

“It doesn’t work.”

I was once again uninterested in watches. Until one day, I saw a YouTube shorts about the G-Shock CasiOak. The metal version. Black. Brutal. Beautiful. I read the reviews. Apparently, it’s built like a tank and requires attention roughly once every five years. I ordered it immediately.

It’s perfect. No apps. No notifications. No battery anxiety. Just time. No distractions. I missed simple tech so much that it almost feels like a luxury now. Anyway it's been only two months with by casioak as of december 2025. I'll update here if I have any further update, until then see you on a different blog. Stay curious!
